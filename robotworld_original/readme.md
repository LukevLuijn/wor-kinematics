RobotWorld building and using (readme)
======================================

Notes:

-   "`\`" at the and of al line, means that the actual command line
    continues with the next line!

-   All command sequences start from the root of the project,
    `$ROBOTWORLD_ROOT` in the examples

-   Adjust all paths to taste, but preferably don't use spaces in any
    path

-   Adjust for any Boost and wxWidgets versions

-   This readme uses wxWidgets-3.1.1 and for Boost-1.68

-   On Windows, use a MinGW MSys command shell, *NOT* a Windows cmd
    shell.

-   If the configure script is missing or out of sync with the installed
    MSys files, run the "`autogen.sh`" script in the root of RobotWorld.
    (use "`./autogen.sh`")

Compilation
-----------

This readme assumes that both Boost and wxWidgets are compiled and
installed using the OSM installation manual (see
<http://onderwijsonline.han.nl>).

### Compilation on Linux

If both Boost and wxWidgets have been compiled and installed as
described in the installation manual, the following commands can be used
to configure and build RobotWorld.

Navigate to the root folder of RobotWorld (for example
"`~/sources/robotworld/`", where "`~`" stands for the home folder of the
user.

    cd ~/sources/robotworld/

    mkdir linux-build

    cd linux-build/

    ../configure --with-cxx=17

    make -j4 2>&1 | tee build.log

Notes:

-   With the command line option `--with-cxx=` it is possible to change
    the target C++-standard. For more information run
    "`../configure --help`".

-   If Boost isn't installed in the default location (not build with the
    `install` option) use the `--with-boost=<path_to_boost>` command
    line option. The `<path_to_boost>` must point to the root directory
    of the installed/compiled Boost. Run "`../configure --help`" for
    details on command line options.

-   If wxWidgets isn't installed in the default location (not build with
    the `install` option) use the
    `--with-wx-config=<path_to_wx_config_file>` command line option. The
    "`<path_to_wx_config_file>`" is the full path of the file
    `wx-config` file. If the installation manual was used, the location
    should be "`~/sources/wxWidgets-3.1.1/build-linux/wx-config`". Run
    "`../configure --help`" for details on command line options.

### Compilation on Windows

If both Boost and wxWidgets have been compiled and installed as
described in the installation manual, the following commands can be used
to configure and build RobotWorld.

Open the MinGW MSys2 terminal (*not* the Windows command line). Navigate
to the root folder of RobotWorld (for example "`/c/robotworld/`")

    cd /c/robotworld/

    mkdir mingw-build 

    cd mingw-build/

    ../configure --with-cxx=17  \
        --with-boost=/c/boost/  \
        --with-wx-config=/c/wxWidgets-3.1.1-mingw/build-mingw/wx-config

    make -j4 2>&1 | tee build.log

Notes:

-   With the command line option `--with-cxx=` it is possible to change
    the target C++-standard. For more information run
    "`../configure --help`".

-   If Boost isn't installed in the location as used in the installation
    manual on OnderwijsOnline, change the `--with-boost=<path_to_boost>`
    command line option. The `<path_to_boost>` must point to the root
    directory of the installed/compiled Boost (containing the "`lib`"
    and "`include`" folders of Boost). Run "`../configure --help`" for
    details on command line options.

-   If wxWidgets isn't installed in the default location (not build with
    the `install` option) use the
    `--with-wx-config=<path_to_wx_config_file>` command line option. The
    "`<path_to_wx_config_file>`" is the full path of the file
    `wx-config` file. If the installation manual was used, the location
    should be "`/c/wxWidgets-3.1.1-mingw/build-mingw/wx-config`". Run
    "`../configure --help`" for details on command line options.

Eclipse instructions
--------------------

### Create Eclipse project

RobotWorld uses a make file for compilation, it is possible to use
Eclipse in combination with a make file. Follow the next steps to create
a project in Eclipse.

1.  Open Eclipse and click "`New C/C++ Project`". Select
    "`C++ Managed Build`" and click "`Next`"(do not use the CMake or
    other *make* projects).

2.  In the next step ("`Create C++ project of selected type`"\*) do the
    following:

    a.  Give the project a name
    b.  Deselect "`Use default location`" and set the location to the
        root of RobotWorld (Linux: "`~/sources/robotworld/`", Windows:
        "`c:\robotworld\`")
    c.  Set project type (left below) to "`Makefile project -> empty`"
    d.  click "`Finish`"

3.  After creating the project, change the build location to compilation
    folder used earlier building RobotWorld. Select "`Properties`" of
    the project, go to "`C/C++ Build`" and change the
    "`Build directory`" (use the button "`Workspace`" ) to the
    compilation folder (Linux: "`~/sources/robotworld/linux-build/`",
    Windows: "`c:\robotworld\mingw-build\`"). Click on
    "`Apply and Close`".

To test if the Eclipse project is configured correctly, click
"`Clean...`" and build the project again. Try to run RobotWorld from
Eclipse by clicking "`Ctrl+F11`" (or use the menu "`Run`").

### Indexer of Eclipse

If using Makefiles to compile programs Eclipse (i.e.Â its indexer with
auto-complete feature, code browsing etc) does not use auto-discovery
features for `#includes` and `#defines`. This must be configured
manually.

This must be done in the "Paths and Symbols" part of the project
settings: "`Project->properties->C/C++ General->Paths and Symbols`" on
the tabs "`includes`" and "`symbols`"

Remarks:

-   If Boost and wxWidgets are installed, one only has to configure the
    wxWidgets defines (-D in the output, see below)

-   If one of them is not installed one has to configure that include
    directories also

    -   Use "`wx-config --cppflags`" for the relevant wxWidgets values

    -   Use the root directory of a staged Boost version

    -   Use "`-std=c++17`" for the indexer and not "`-std=gnu++17`" if
        the C++ standard headers are not resolved

-   Use "`Window->Show view->Other->C/C++ index`" to find any unresolved
    header files or unresolved other C/C++ symbols.

### Debugging in Eclipse (windows)

-   Both Boost and wxWidgets lib directory must have been adde to the
    PATH variable.

-   Change the `C/C++ Application` launch target to `robotworld.exe` in
    the (hidden) folder `.libs`.
    
### Using static code checkers

The configure script checks for the availability of cppcheck and clang-tidy. As clang-tidy needs
a compilation database the configure script also checks if "bear" or "compiledb" are installed.

If cppcheck is available just run "make cppcheck".

If clang-tidy is available one first has to create a compilation database ("compile_commands.json").
Depending on having bear of compiledb run "make bear" or "make compiledb". After that run "make clangtidy"

Bear is installable on Debian: "apt install bear"
More info: https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear

For compiledb: Installation and usage instructions: see https://github.com/nickdiego/compiledb.
 
    
### Using Sanitizers

- If you compile with "-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=leak -fsanitize=undefined" you must link with "-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=leak -fsanitize=undefined" for linking with the correct libraries.
- If your IDE does not support that you can link with asan en usan (in that order!)
- If the LeakSanitizer gives false positives you can add those (after careful inspection!!!) to the LeakSanitizerSuppression.txt
